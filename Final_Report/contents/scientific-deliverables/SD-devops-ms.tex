\section{Scientific Deliverable \thesdel\ -- What is the relationship
between DevOps and Microservices?}

\subsection{Requirements}

This scientific deliverable aims to find a relationship between the
DevOps approach and the \gls{ms} style. In the design section we are
therefore first going to introduce aspects of both DevOps and
\glspl{ms}. The production section will then draw parallels between
the presented characteristics which in turn allows us to observe how
both concepts are connected to each other. In the assessment we will
talk about threats to the validity of our discussions.

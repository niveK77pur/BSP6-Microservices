I would like to thank my tutor Alfredo Capozucca for being very
pleasant to work with. He would always take his time to explain or
clarify some things and made sure I understood what is going on. In
addition, when in doubt or stuck he was happy to help and always gave
me the right hints and nudge to the correct path.

In addition, I also want to thank Boris Floka who is a prior team
member of E4L and had great responsibility in creating the back-end.
Figuring out how to properly obtain data from \gls{e4l} was not very
obvious and he was very responsive and happy to help me achieve this.

% The authors would like to thank the BiCS management and education team for the amazing work done.

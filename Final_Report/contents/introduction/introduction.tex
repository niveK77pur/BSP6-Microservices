\section{Introduction (± 5\% of total words)}

This paper presents the bachelor semester project made by Motivated Student together with Motivated Tutor as his motivated tutor.
It presents the scientific and technical dimensions of the work done. All the words written here have been newly created by the authors and if some sequence of words or any graphic information created by others are included then it is explicitly indicated the original reference to the work reused. 

This report separates explicitly the scientific work from the technical one. In deed each BSP must cover those two dimensions with a constrained balance  (cf. \cite{bics-bsp-reference-document}). Thus it is up to the Motivated Tutor and Motivated Student to ensure that the deliverables belonging to each dimension are clearly stated. As an example, a project whose title would be ``A multi-user game for multi-touch devices'' could define as scientific~\cite{armstrong2017guidelinesforscience} deliverables the following ones:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Study of concurrency models and their implementation
	\item Study of ergonomics in human-computer interaction
\end{itemize}

The length of the report should be from 6000 to 8000 words excluding images and annexes. The sections presenting the technical and scientific deliverables represent ± 80\% of total words of the report.

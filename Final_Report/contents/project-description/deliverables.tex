\subsection{Targeted Deliverables}
\label{sec-deliverables}
\subsubsection{Scientific deliverables}
Provide a synthetic and abstract description of the scientific deliverables that were targeted to be produced. 
Each BSP must contain some work done according to the principles of the scientific method. It basically means that you should define at least one question related to the knowledge domain of your BSP and follow part of the scientific method process to answer to this question. The description of the work done to answer this question is a scientific deliverable.

Examples of question could be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is Python an adequate language for concurrent programs?
	\item How can we measure the ergonomic of a graphical user interface?
	\item How can we ensure that a program will not fail?
\end{itemize}

An answer to such question should be the result of applying partly or totally the scientific method according to its standard definition which can be found in the literature.

As you can see in this template, the scientific deliverable is entirely separated from the technical deliverable. Of course it addresses a question more or less closely related to the technical deliverable. 

\subsubsection{Technical deliverables}
Provide a synthetic and abstract description of the technical deliverables that were targeted to be produced.

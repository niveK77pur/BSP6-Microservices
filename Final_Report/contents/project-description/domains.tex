\KB{The scientific domain concerns software engineering and the DevOps

This will be of interest for the technical domain.}

\subsubsection{Technical}

Provide a description of the technical domain(s) in which the project is being made.

\KB{The technical domain also concerns software engineering but
	focuses on software architectures, namely the \gls{ms} architecture.
	Here we will briefly introduce what software architectures are and
	how they impact the final product. For this we shall shortly
introduce the monolithic and \gls{ms} style. The latter is the one we
relied on for our technical productions.}

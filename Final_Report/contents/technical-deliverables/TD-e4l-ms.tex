\section{Technical Deliverable \thetdel\ -- Does E4L allow for easy
deployment of adjacent Microservices?}

\subsection{Requirements}

Our case study consisted in creating a \gls{ms} relying on the
\gls{e4l} application. The latter is built using a monolithic
architecture, and we want to find out how easy it is to deploy an
adjacent \gls{ms} application.

The \gls{ms} to be created should allow us to test the hypothesis that
\glspl{ms} are easy to create and deploy. Further, it should fit into
our \gls{e4l} case study---we will have our service display a graph
based on data collected by the \gls{e4l} application.  To close
everything off, we shall also create a GitLab pipeline that automates
the deployment of this \gls{ms}.

Hence, the design section will tackle all the steps we had to
undertake in order to reach the final and fully automated deployment
pipeline. The production section will dive into the technical details
and difficulties of each step. The assessment is going to lay out our
judgement on how easy it was to deploy the \gls{ms} given the current
\gls{e4l} application architecture.

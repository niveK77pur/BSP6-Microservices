% {\color{gray}

\subsection{Scientific pre-requisites}

The main scientific knowledge needed for this \gls{bsp} was a general
understanding of software engineering, and the life cycle of software.
It was of great value given how \glspl{ms}---studied during this
project---are a further evolution and approach for development in the software
engineering domain.

\subsection{Technical pre-requisites}

The technical knowledge needed here was familiarity with the Python
programming language as we ended up relying on it for the
implementation of our \gls{ms}. Also being able to work in a Linux
environment was important for the later stages of the project to
recreate a local development environment that was as close as
possible to the deployment environment.
% where we
% wanted to manually deploy the application on a Linux server, using a
% Linux docker container.

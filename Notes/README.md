In this folder you will find various notes of mine. These have all been collected and compiled in order to attempt answering the research questions as well as validating the claims on microservices.

As a little side note: These markdown files have been written on or for <https://hackmd.io>, so a few things might not be rendered as expected here on GitHub. Every document will have a *Collaborate on HackMD* badge that leads you to the corresponding viewing page on HackMD.
